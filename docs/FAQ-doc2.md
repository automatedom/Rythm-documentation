2. In order for __any__ commands to work hile using Rythm __you must__ make sure that the prefix is at the beginning of any command you use. Rythms default prefix is known to be `!`.

### How can I add a Second Rythm to my server?
Due to high demand we have added the ability to add a second Rythm to your server allowing for twice the music.

1. If you are in need of a Second Rythm within your server you can invite Rythm 2 by [clicking here](https://rythmbot.co/rythm2).

### How can I change the location of Rythm Announcing Songs?
Rythm will announce songs in the channel the command is used. Look below to see how to change the location of the announces of songs.

1. Let's say you used the `!play Song_URL` and/or `!summon` command in the channel `#music-commands`. In `#music-command` Rythm will start announcing songs in the channel in which you used the command. 
2. If you would like to change th location of the song announcements, you can do `!disconnect` and use `!play Song_URL` and/or `!summon` in a different channel within your server.

### How can I view more than page using the queue command?
You can view more than one queue pages by doing the following below.

1. To view more queue pages `!queue <Page_Number>`.
    + **Example:** `!queue 2`
    + **Example:** `!queue 3`

![QueueNumber](/static/img/faq/queue-number.png)

### How can I remove duplicate songs from the queue?
To remove duplicate songs you can use the command as shown below.

1. `!removedupes`
+ Rythm will then remove all duplicates of any songs within your servers queue.

### Why can some normal users access moderative music commands?
1. Normal users with no special permissions are only allowed to use the `!play` command to add songs to the queue by default.
They can also use other commands that don't affect the playing music in any way. Example: `!queue` and `!lyrics`.
2. However, normal users can access ALL music commands when they are alone with Rythm in the voice channel.
This is because their commands would not affect anyone but themselves.
+ For more information about users command permissions, refer to the **Roles/Permissions** section in this FAQ.

### How many votes are needed for a song to be vote skipped?
**__Here's an example:__**

1. For a vote skip to take effect, **75% of the voice chat's** population need to vote yes.
2. Let's assume there are **10** users in a voice chat.
3. The threshold for skipping is calculated as **75% of 10 = 7.5**, then rounded down, so **7**.
3. For the vote skip to take effect, you would then need **7 positive** votes.

:::caution note
Vote skip will not be active until there are **3 or more people** in the voice channel.
(As with one person, insta-skip is enabled and with two the threshold for skipping is 1).

7. Spotify  [(Spotify Link Click Here)](https://www.spotify.com/)

### Can I adjust the volume for everyone on my server for Rythm?
+ **Short Answer:** [`Yes, if you Donate`](https://patreon.com/rythm)
    + You may set the local volume of Rythm for yourself by selecting Rythm and adjusting the user volume slider as shown below.

![VolumeMenu](/static/img/faq/user-volume.png)

+ Rythm uses the default volume for videos when using audio streams, for donators we allow for encoding to change the volume of these audio streams. Due to the fact that encoding takes resources and time, this is why we do not roll this feature out to all Rythm users.

**Donators**

1. For donators the volume command is !volume number *(Allowed Values: 1 ➠ 200)*.
    + **Example:** `!volume 80`

### Can I make custom commands for Rythm?
+ **Short Answer:** `No`
    + We do not allow custom commands/aliases, however we do allow for suggestions of aliases to be added.

1. Use the `!aliases` command to view all the aliases.
    + You can suggest any aliases that you can think of in the `#rythm-suggestions` channel on the Rythm Bot Discord server.

### Can Rythm play 24/7 Music?
+ **Short Answer:** `No`
    + Rythm is not a **24/7** bot. However you can self host [this bot](https://github.com/repulser/moosic) to gain that feature.

### How is it possible for Rythm to be in so many servers all in once?

Discord allows bots over `2,000 Thousand` Servers to use a feature called `Sharding`. In Rythms case, we are known as the largest music bot on Discord, so we require lots of shards to maintain uptime. For more detail, please [click here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding) to view more about Discords Sharding feature.

<!-- The start of the Roles/Permissions Section -->
## Roles/Permissions
-----
### What are the commands that users can use?
Rythm’s built-in permission system can be divided in the following groups:

**Normal Users/Users without any special roles:**

1. Are able to add songs to the list (queue) but can’t remove them.
2. Are able to use commands that don’t interfere with other people’s music. 
    + **Example:** `lyrics`, `np`, `queue`, etc.
3. Can't skip a song without voting.
5. Don’t have access to control the music in any way.

**Users with a DJ role/Manage Channels permission:**

1. Have full access to all music commands.
2. Can’t change Rythm’s settings.

:::caution note
If there isn’t a role named "DJ" in your server, one can be created with no special permissions assigned and it will still access these features.
:::

**Users with Manage Server/Administrator permission:**

1. `Manage Server:` Users with the **Manage Server** permission can change Rythm’s settings,
but are limited to only use the normal user's music commands.
2. `Administrator:` Users with the **Administrator** permission have full access to all music commands
and can also change Rythm’s settings.

:::danger note
If a user is **ALONE** in a voice channel and Rythm is with them, they **WILL** have access to **ALL** of the music commands even if the user does **NOT** have the **DJ** role. Since there is no one to control and tell them what music they can or cannot play, they can just control the music on their own and live a happy life, but if another user joins in, then they lose their ability to control music and they would need the **DJ** role.
+ If you want all Rythm commands to be only available to people with a specific role, read the next entry in this FAQ.
:::

### How can I give normal users access to all of the music commands?
Here we will be teaching you how to setup music commands with Discord Permissions.

**Permission**

1. Users with the `Manage Channels` Permission will be able to access all of the music commands. This is what it should look like, look at the image shown below.

![ManageChannels](/static/img/faq/manage-channel.png)

2. Users with the `Manage Server` Permission will be able to access all of the setting commands. This is what it should look like, look at the image shown below.

![ManageServer](/static/img/faq/manage-server.png)

**Command**

In this case if you do not want users having the `Manage Channel` permission to use commands, you can follow the steps below to give them permissions using a couple of ways.

1. Go to **Server Settings** ➠ **Roles** ➠ Make a new role called `DJ`.
2. You can use the following command to set another DJ Role: Command usage `!settings djrole @role/role-name`.
    + **Example:** `!settings djrole NewDJRole`
    + **Example:** `!settings djrole @NewDJRole`
3. The DJ role has to be assigned manually and cannot be given to all users at once, unless you are using another bot that supports giving all roles to users at once.

**Users alone in a voice channel with Rythm will be treated as though they have the DJ role until another user joins the voice channel with them even if they have no roles**

:::caution
Members with the `"DJ Role"` will not be able to change **ANY** of the Settings Commands.
:::

### Blacklisting Voice Channels
