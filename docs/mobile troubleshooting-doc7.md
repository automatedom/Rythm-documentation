If you are on mobile and you find that you cannot add Rythm due to the fact that the link to add Rythm produces a gray screen, then please head to https://discordapp.com/login. Once you're there, try logging in and then using the invite link again. If that does not work, we recommend using a desktop device.

In short: You may want to try refreshing the website to add Rythm or use a desktop device.

Also, please note that adding bots using mobile devices is not supported by Discord and may not work. If the above method does not work for you and you are still unable to invite Rythm, please go to https://dis.gd/support to be assisted further with your issue.
